# Spectrum

![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/berkcodes/spectrum)

Spectrum is a room frequency response app designed to be easy to use while packing the features that are useful for audio and HiFi enthusiasts. While it isn't going to replace an ECM8000, it is at least portable, free and can double as a sound meter.
